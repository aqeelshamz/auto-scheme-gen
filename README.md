## Abstract

The Automatic Scheme Generation software is an innovative solution that
allows law enforcement agencies to efficiently plan and deploy resources for
events and VIP visits. With this software, authorized personnel can cre-
ate detailed bandobast schemes, generate reports, and deploy resources with
ease. The new scheme page features an interactive map where users can cre-
ate sectors and pin exact locations for deployment, ensuring precise allocation
of personnel. The software also includes a report generation feature, allowing
users to generate reports and download them in either PDF or XLSX format.  

In addition to these features, the software also includes an automatic
notification system that sends messages by email and SMS to the policemen
with the information of their deployment, including their exact location,
duty time, and the individual they are working under. This ensures that all
personnel are informed of their duties and responsibilities, and that resources
are deployed efficiently. Security is a top priority, and the software is designed
to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to view and create
schemes.
